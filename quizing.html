<p>Computer: A Computer is a General-purpose machine, commonly consisting of digital circuitry, that accepts (inputs), stores, manipulates, and generates (outputs) data as numbers, text, graphics, voice, video files, or electrical signals, in accordance with instructions called a program.<br><br>
Input Devices – Computer Knowledge
An input device feeds data to the computer system for processing.

We are going to discuss the most commonly used input devices in this article.<br><br>

Keyboard

The computer keyboard is to enter text information into the computer.
The main use of the keyboard is to type commands directing the computer to perform certain actions.
Mouse

A device that controls the movement of the cursor or pointer on a display screen.
A mouse is a small object you can roll along a hard, flat surface.
The invention of the mouse is made by Douglas Engelbart of Stanford Research Center in 1963.<br><br>
Joystick

Joysticks and similar game controllers can also be connected to a computer as pointing devices<br><br>
Scanner

A scanner is a device that images a printed page or graphics by digitizing it, producing an image made of tiny pixels of different brightness and colour values which are represented numerically and sent to the computer.
Scanners not only scan graphics, but they can also scan pages of text.
<br><br>MIDI Devices

MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a system design to transmit information between electronic musical instruments.
Trackball

The trackball is sort of like an upside-down mouse, with the ball located on top.
You use your fingers to roll the trackball, and internal rollers (similar to what’s inside a mouse) sense the motion which is transmitted to the computer.
Trackballs have the advantage over mice in that the body of the trackball remains stationary on your desk.
<br><br>Graphics Tablet

A graphics tablet consists of an electronic writing area and a special “pen” that works with it.
A graphics tablet allows creating graphical images with motions and actions.
<br><br>Computer Knowledge – Output Devices
<br><br>Monitor

Monitors, commonly called as Visual Display Unit (VDU), are the main output device of a computer.
It forms images from tiny dots, known as pixels that make an arrangement in a form of a rectangular form.
The sharpness of the image depends upon the number of pixels.
Printers

The printer is an output device, which is to print information on paper.

There are two types of printers:

Impact Printers
Non-Impact Printers
<br><br>Plotters

A plotter is a printer that interprets commands from a computer to make line drawings on paper with one or more automated pens.
Unlike a regular printer, the plotter can draw continuous point-to-point lines directly from vector graphics files or commands.
<br><br>Projector

A projector or image projector is an optical device, which projects an image (or moving images) onto a surface, commonly a projection screen.
<br><br>Speakers

Speakers are one of the most common output devices with computer systems.
Some speakers are designed for work specifically with computers, while others can be hooked up to any type of sound system.<br><br>
<br><br><br><br>This Basics of Computer Science Online Test simulates a real online certification exams. <br>
 <br>You will be presented Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on General Knowledge Concepts, where you will be given four options.
 <br>You will select the best suitable answer for the question and then proceed to the next question without wasting given time. 
 <br>You will get your online test score after finishing the complete test.</p>
